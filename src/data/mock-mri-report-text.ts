MRI OF THE LUMBOSACRAL SPINE

TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the lumbosacral spine was performed.

FINDINGS:
- Vertebral body alignment is maintained. Marrow signal is within normal limits.
- L4-L5: There is a diffuse posterior disc bulge causing mild narrowing of the central canal. The neural foramina are patent.
- L5-S1: A broad-based right paracentral disc protrusion is seen, indenting the thecal sac and resulting in moderate right neural foraminal narrowing. The exiting S1 nerve root is contacted.
- Other intervertebral discs appear normal in height and signal intensity.
- The conus medullaris terminates at the L1 level and is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Degenerative disc disease.
2.  L5-S1 right paracentral disc protrusion causing moderate foraminal stenosis and contacting the S1 nerve root.
3.  Mild diffuse disc bulge at L4-L5.

Radiologist: Dr. C. Imaging
